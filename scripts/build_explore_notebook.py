# Exploring the NYC Taxi Dataset: Source to Every Output

A detailed, visual tour of the data behind this project, built for students who are
**new to machine learning**.

We will trace one month of data through every Phase 1 transformation:

1. **Official source** and local raw files.
2. **Raw schema** and the meaning of one trip row.
3. **Validation and cleaning**, including every configured rule.
4. **Demand branch**: trips to zone-hour counts to model features.
5. **Fare branch**: cleaned trips to per-trip model features.
6. **Chronological train, validation and test splits**.
7. **Persisted artifacts** and the code that consumes them.

## 1. Official source and local landing files

The data is the **official NYC TLC (Taxi & Limousine Commission) Trip Record
Data** — free, public, and anonymized. The project downloads one month at a time
(by default **January 2024**) plus a zone lookup table that translates numeric
location identifiers into borough, zone and service-zone labels.

| Source object | Official location | Local landing file | Format |
|---|---|---|---|
| Yellow Taxi trip records | TLC monthly trip-data CDN | `data/raw/yellow_tripdata_2024-01.parquet` | Parquet |
| Taxi zone lookup | TLC miscellaneous-data CDN | `data/raw/taxi_zone_lookup.csv` | CSV |

The exact year, month, URLs and local directories come from `config/config.yaml`.
`src/data/ingestion.py` streams downloads in 1 MiB chunks, writes a temporary
`.part` file, then renames it only after completion. Existing files are cached
unless overwrite is requested.

### Who creates and updates it, and when?

- Authorized technology providers under the Taxi & Livery Passenger
    Enhancement Programs (TPEP/LPEP) collect and submit Yellow/Green trip records
    to NYC TLC. TLC states that it did not create those submitted records and does
    not guarantee their accuracy.
- **NYC TLC publishes the files monthly**, typically with an approximately
    **two-month delay** so vendors can complete submissions.
- There is no guaranteed calendar day. TLC can correct historical files and
    standardize schemas; check the official page's download links and Errata
    before treating a cached file as the latest version.
- This project does **not** poll for new months automatically. It downloads the
    year/month selected in configuration or `TLC_TRIP_YEAR` and
    `TLC_TRIP_MONTH`. The repository default remains January 2024 until changed.

The official Yellow Taxi data dictionary documents the broader published
fields: pickup/drop-off times and zones, distance, rate and payment types,
passenger count, and itemized fare components. The project uses the eight-field
contract shown below.

The notebook calculates stages in memory for inspection; the pipeline is the
owner of persisted artifacts.

|---|---|---|---|
| Raw trips | `data/raw/yellow_tripdata_2024-01.parquet` | One published TLC trip | validation |
| Zone lookup | `data/raw/taxi_zone_lookup.csv` | One TLC zone | analysis/dashboard labels |
| Clean trips | `data/processed/trips_clean.parquet` | One valid trip | fare features + demand aggregation |
| Hourly demand | `data/processed/demand_hourly.parquet` | One pickup zone-hour | demand features + serving history |
| Demand features | `data/features/demand_features.parquet` | One model-ready zone-hour | inspection/splitting |
| Fare features | `data/features/fare_features.parquet` | One model-ready trip | inspection/splitting |
| Demand splits | `data/features/demand_{train,val,test}.parquet` | Chronological model partitions | demand training/evaluation |
| Fare splits | `data/features/fare_{train,val,test}.parquet` | Chronological model partitions | fare training/evaluation |
| Pipeline summary | `data/processed/pipeline_summary.json` | Counts and cleaning evidence | audit/readiness checks |

The demand serving service also reads `data/processed/demand_hourly.parquet` as
recent history for lag and rolling features. Model training reads the split
Parquet files. Human-readable zone names are joined later for reporting; they
are not personal location traces.

## 8. Lineage checks and limitations

Use these checks to defend the lineage rather than merely showing files:

1. Clean rows must not exceed raw rows; the cleaning report explains removals.
2. Demand has exactly one row for every observed pickup-zone/hour combination
   after densification.
3. Fare feature rows equal clean trip rows; no aggregation occurs.
4. Lag and rolling demand features use prior observations within the same zone.
5. Train time ends no later than validation time; validation ends no later than
   test time.

Interpretation limits: this is one month of Yellow Taxi data, not Green Taxi or
FHV data; zone IDs are coarse geography; no rider/driver demographics or exact
GPS coordinates are present; cleaning bounds encode assumptions; and one month
cannot represent annual seasonality or long-term change.

## Recap

- Official TLC Parquet and CSV files land in `data/raw/` with their original
    structure preserved.
- Validation applies an explicit schema, period, null and plausibility contract.
- The demand branch changes the grain from one trip to one zone-hour, then adds
    past-only calendar, lag and rolling features.
- The fare branch preserves one row per clean trip and predicts base fare.
- Both branches are split chronologically and persisted for model training.
