"""Responsible-AI tooling.

Because the NYC taxi trip data contains no demographic or otherwise protected
attributes, Responsible AI here focuses on **geographic & temporal service
equity** and **transparency** rather than classic demographic fairness:

- ``fairness``   — sliced performance metrics + disparity ratios across
  boroughs, time-of-day, weekend/holiday and airport zones (numpy/pandas only).
- ``explain``    — SHAP (TreeExplainer) global feature importance and
  per-prediction contributions for the tree models.
- ``model_card`` — render a markdown model card from metadata, metrics, fairness
  and top features.

``fairness`` and ``model_card`` are dependency-light and unit-testable; the SHAP
summary-plot helper guards its matplotlib import.
