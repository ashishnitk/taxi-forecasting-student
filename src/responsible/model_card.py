"""Render a Markdown model card from model metadata, metrics and fairness.

Model cards (Mitchell et al., 2019) document a model's intended use, training
data, evaluation — including **subgroup** performance — and its ethical
considerations and limitations, so downstream users can judge whether the model
is appropriate for their context.
