# Local Setup

Run all commands from the repository root using Python 3.11. Allow several GB
for packages, data and model artifacts; 16 GB RAM is recommended for full-data
training. Commands below use Windows PowerShell and the explicit virtual
environment interpreter. On other systems use the corresponding `.venv/bin/python`.

## 1. Environment and Tests

```powershell
python --version
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m ruff check .
```

No activation or execution-policy change is necessary. The test suite uses
synthetic inputs and mocked cloud clients. A passing test suite does not prove
cloud availability or model accuracy. Core requirements do not include the
optional dashboard or managed-monitoring dependencies.

## 2. Data Pipeline

Defaults select January 2024 Yellow Taxi records from NYC TLC. Review
[data limitations](DATA_STATEMENT.md) before using the output.

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m scripts.run_pipeline --year 2024 --month 1
```

This downloads raw data, cleans trips, creates dense hourly zone counts, builds
features, and writes chronological train/validation/test splits. Outputs are
under `data/raw`, `data/processed`, and `data/features`. The cleaning summary is
`data/processed/pipeline_summary.json`. After a successful download, the same
pipeline can be rerun with `--skip-download` to reuse the cache.

## 3. Training and Registry

Start with one tuning trial per estimator on each problem:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m scripts.train_models --n-trials 1
```

Both XGBoost and LightGBM use the full splits. This is still substantive
training, not a tiny synthetic example. Omitting `--n-trials` uses the configured
25 trials. The winner is selected by validation RMSE; candidate test scores are
logged but must not be used to tune or select models.

The default tracking store is `sqlite:///mlflow.db`, with artifacts under
`mlruns/`. Winners register as `taxi-demand-forecaster` and `taxi-fare-predictor`.
SHAP plots and model cards are generated under `artifacts/`. The optional
`--no-register` flag logs runs but does not create serving registrations.

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m mlflow ui --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5000
```

The UI at <http://127.0.0.1:5000> does not train or register a model itself.

## 4. API

After preparing both registered models and demand history:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m uvicorn src.serving.api:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Use <http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs> for requests. Check readiness in another terminal:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8000/health"
```

Require JSON `status: ok`, both models loaded, and nonzero history and zones.
The endpoint can return HTTP 200 with degraded JSON. [API examples](API_EXAMPLES.md)
cover fare, demand, recursive forecasting and SHAP requests.

## 5. Batch and Analysis

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m scripts.batch_forecast --horizon 3
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m scripts.responsible.run_analysis
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m scripts.monitoring.demo_drift_report --problem all --mode drift
```

Batch forecasts append rows to `predictions.db`. Repeated runs do not replace
earlier output. The `latest` model reference is mutable and is not a resolved
numeric model lineage identifier.

Responsible analysis reads registered models and held-out test splits, writing
`docs/model_cards/` and `artifacts/responsible/`. Drift output is written under
`artifacts/drift/`; `--mode drift` deliberately shifts two numeric features and
is not evidence of a production incident. `--mode clean` uses unshifted samples.
Analysis commands can replace reports in those locations; preserve any evidence
you need before regenerating it. Global SHAP plots do not explain one named trip.

## 6. Dashboard

Generate the analysis outputs above, then run:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements-dashboard.txt
$env:API_BASE_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:8000"
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m streamlit run dashboard/app.py --server.address 127.0.0.1 --server.port 8501
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8501>. The dashboard combines live API calls with local
report files; their timestamps and model identities may differ. Missing reports
are displayed as unavailable, not replaced with bundled historical results.
Revenue panels use an illustrative average-fare assumption, not realized revenue.
If a port is occupied, choose a free one and update the API URL consistently.

## 7. Optional Containers

Docker must be installed separately. First complete data preparation and model
registration. Create a portable copy of the registry for Linux artifact paths:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m scripts.make_mlflow_portable --src mlflow.db --dest mlflow.container.db --new-base file:///app/mlruns
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up --build
```

The Compose services mount the portable database, `mlruns/`, and data. Stop the
local API/MLflow processes first if ports 8000/5000 are in use. Regenerate the
portable database after new local registrations. The dashboard image also
requires generated cards, responsible/drift reports, and the zone lookup; it
is not built by the API/MLflow Compose stack.

## 8. Optional Cloud and Configuration

Central configuration is in `config/config.yaml`. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
only when you need local overrides and no `.env` already exists. Do not commit
credentials, raw data, models, state files or local databases. The dashboard
reads `API_BASE_URL` from its process environment, so set it in the shell.

See [the infrastructure runbook](../infra/terraform/README.md) before any cloud
operation. `requirements-monitoring.txt` supplies AWS SDK and optional reporting
dependencies; it is not needed for core local tests. A managed job is not the
same as an always-on API. Neither a drift flag nor a passing quality gate grants
automatic deployment permission.
