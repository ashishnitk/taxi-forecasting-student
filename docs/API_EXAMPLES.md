# API Examples

Start the API after data preparation and model registration as described in
[setup](SETUP.md). These examples use <http://127.0.0.1:8000>. Swagger is at
`/docs`, OpenAPI at `/openapi.json`, and Prometheus metrics at `/metrics`.

## Readiness

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8000/health"
```

Inspect the body, not just the status code. Require both model flags and
`status: ok` for prediction readiness.

## Fare

```powershell
$fare = @{
    trip_distance = 3.4
    pu_location_id = 132
    do_location_id = 230
    passenger_count = 1
    pickup_datetime = "2024-01-15T18:30:00"
} | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict/fare" -ContentType "application/json" -Body $fare
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8000/explain/fare" -ContentType "application/json" -Body $fare
```

The response predicts `fare_amount` in dollars, not `total_amount`. Duration is
estimated when `trip_duration_min` is omitted, indicated by `duration_estimated`.
Include a valid duration when it is available at the intended prediction time.
SHAP contributions describe model arithmetic, not causal effects.

## Recursive Demand Forecast

```powershell
$forecast = @{ horizon_hours = 3; zones = @(132, 161, 230) } | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8000/forecast/demand" -ContentType "application/json" -Body $forecast
```

Without a start time, forecasting begins one hour after the latest stored demand
history. It does not automatically advance historical data to the present.
The response includes forecast points, request ID and model reference. Later
recursive hours use previous predicted counts as history.

## Single Demand Prediction

For the default January 2024 history, this requests the following hour:

```powershell
$demand = @{ zone = 132; target_hour = "2024-02-01T00:00:00" } | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict/demand" -ContentType "application/json" -Body $demand
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8000/explain/demand" -ContentType "application/json" -Body $demand
```

Choose a time with sufficient prior lag/rolling history for other datasets.
Single-step prediction does not fill arbitrarily missing history. Invalid
schemas return 422; unknown zones or unsupported history can return 400.
Responses include an `X-Request-ID` header for tracing.

## Python Client

```python
from clients.python.taxi_client import TaxiClient

client = TaxiClient("http://127.0.0.1:8000")
print(client.health())
print(client.forecast_demand(horizon_hours=3, zones=[132, 161, 230]))
```

Do not compare predictions to fixed expected amounts across differently trained
model versions. Validate the input contract and inspect the current model output.
